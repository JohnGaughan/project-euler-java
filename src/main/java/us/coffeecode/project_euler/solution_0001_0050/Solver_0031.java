/**
 * <p>
 * <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=31">Problem 31</a> asks us to find the number of combinations possible to
 * add up to Â£2 using UK currency.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is a simple dynamic programming solution that builds up the number of combinations for each weight and each
 * total, finding the number of new combinations at each step. It ends up being able to skip a lot of redundant
 * combinations, ending up with a single answer for the total weight in the end.
